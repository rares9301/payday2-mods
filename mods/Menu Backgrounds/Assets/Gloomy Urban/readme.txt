Wallpapers taken from the Gloomy Urban Thread #2 on 4chan.org/w/ https://boards.4channel.org/w/thread/2164311/gloomy-urban-thread-2

Wallpapers have been cropped and resized in order to meet the needs of Menu Backgrounds Mod by Luffy.

If you run into any problems with the size of the wallpaper, set its resolution to 1600 * 900 or 1280 * 720 in Microsoft Paint or another program with resizing capabilities.

I do not know whom the original works in this pack belong to; I will update the pack to give credit where credit is due (where I can find it), but if any of the original artists wish for this mod to be removed, DM me. I will do my best to respond as swiftly as possible.

Thank you and enjoy the papes!

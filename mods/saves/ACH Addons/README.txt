README - generated from AdvancedCrosshair v2 - 

This directory is where you can install add-on folders for Crosshairs, Hitmarkers, or Hitsounds.
These must be folders, no archives or files- .texture, .zip, .7zip, .tar, etc. will not be read!
To install add-ons, place the add-on folder(s) in one of the three subfolders according to the type of add-on- NOT directly in the same folder as this file.

Please refer to the documentation for more information: 
https://github.com/offyerrocker/PD2-AdvancedCrosshairs

P.S. You can safely delete this readme file if you wish. It will only be re-generated on launch if ACH is installed and the ACH Addons folder is removed.
Have a nice day!
